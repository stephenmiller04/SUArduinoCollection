##Temperature sensor tutorial (103 Thermistor)
In this tutorial I show you how to setup the `103 Thermistor` with the **Arduino**.

There are two versions of this Thermistor, a 10k and a 100k version. For the 10k thermistor you need a 10k resistance, for a 100k thermistor, you need a 100k resistance. If you have these, connect it together like on the circuit diagram:

Upload the example code to your **Arduino**, and you now have a working temperature sensor!
