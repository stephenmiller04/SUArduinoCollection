# Stephen's Ultimate Arduino Collection

###### (Updated frequently)
Hello there! If you are searching for tutorials, how to use sensors and other accessories with **Arduino**, you come to the right place!

## What is this?
You are not the only one who bought a new insteresting thing for **Arduino**, but you don't know how to use it. The first thing you do, you search for `<interestingthingyoubought> arduino tutorial`... And you find a ton of instructions. Sometimes a lot of incorrect instruction, that show you a buggy code, without the needed library, or the worst you can find, incorrect circuit diagram that can burn your new thing. I'm tired about that, so I created a place to collect here the perfect tutorials for the most sensors and accessories!

In this collection you find tutorials, examples and circuit diagrams for a lot of sensors and accessories for Arduino (and I will keep updating the collection).
